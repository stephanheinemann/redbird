Installation is very simple. Just unzip everything to a directory and you're ready to run. The program and its files need to be together to work. There are no interpreter "runtime" DLLs to worry about installing either. Everything needed is included.

Help is available via a set of local web pages that are included in this zip file. They go in the same place as AirEd.exe for help to work.

Knowing that [1101] of the .AIR file is of great importance, having noticed many ???, I have tried to simplify and explain things in the various records. Hopefully the adjusted 'aired'.ini file (R. Freimuth) works well for you, if not use the copy of the Freimuth original instead..., without my amendments.

IMPORTANT is to have the Center of Gravity (CG) !-preset-! in the aircraft CFG file 'wing_pos_apex_lon' entry, which you must verify in the FS9 "fuel and cargo" load menu options (from create flight) at the small aircraft shown there! Before you start using AirEd do that. The CG MUST be at or between the 2nd and 3rd red dash behind the leading wing edge of the "silly" wing that is shown... If not, your plane will either dive down or pitch up on take-off...!
So, when adjusting an existing, ill-behaving aircraft go there first. When in doubt about + or - signs in the CFG file, just fill in a larger value, f.e. -20 to see its effect on the "fuel and cargo load" airplane-graphic in FS9. Nextly go from there to find the correct values.

In AirEd click the right mouse button to see the INFO menu option. Here I have written my suggestions and explanations, which sometimes divert from things thought to be found there before...!
