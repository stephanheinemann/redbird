Hi Peter, here are the files related to editing the .air files

 The main one is  aired152_update806, the .air editor package, as a .zip file.  It contains the standalone  app, AirEd (with the icon of the plane), also in the package is   AirEdit152YahiaAlWajid.zip, which is supposed to be a simplified version, but also contains a notepad file,  AirEdReadme, which has more detailed info about centers of gravity and  line 1101 'primary aerodynamics' in any given .air file.
  
There is also an HTML document  'DataTypes' , that shows how to edit each type of line in the file.  the .air files are located with each  SimObject ( which coincidentally is the name of the folder in the main FSX folder, where the airplanes are located, the main folder may have it's own name,  eg; FSX, MSFS, FS or ?)

 Here is my location sample for the 172,  E:\MSFS\SimObjects\Airplanes\C172

 I've also included a .cfg file for the 172, and for familiarization, an unaltered fsx.cfg file, editable in notepad, and a .air & .cfg file for another aircraft
