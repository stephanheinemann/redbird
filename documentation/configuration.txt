C:/Redbird/USB_Device.txt
- identifies a panel and associates an aircraft identifier with the panel
- the aircraft identifier references the aircraft file and directory
- there is also a backup directory under C:/Redbird/Restore/
- it is unclear when and how often backups are taken

E:/*.FLT, *.WX, *.FSSAVE
- the USB drive stores flight, weather and state data for each aircraft mission
- the *.FLT files contain the aircraft identifier under the [Sim.0] section
- assume the FLT files are filtered for the aircraft

Lockheed Martin/Prepare3D/SimObjects/Airplanes/
- contains the aircraft files
- the aircraft identifier is to be used and referenced in several files
- model, sound and texture directories
- aircraft.cfg and *.air (flight physics model) files

Lockheed Martin/Prepare3D/(gauges)
- contains files and archives (*.cab) with cockpit elements

C:/Users/Redbird/Documents/Prepare3dFiles
- contains saved files

The visual context menu can be open with right mouse key
The flight simulator menus can be opened after un-hiding the menu
in the visual context menu and then using the left mouse key on the top
of the main window

C:/Users/Redbird/AppData/Roaming/Lockheed Martin/Prepar3D
- stores Prepare3D application data
- Prepar3D.cfg is similar to FSX.cfg
- scenery.cfg

C:/Users/Redbird/AppData/Roaming/Lockheed Martin/Prepar3D/Controls/Standard.xml
- stores the control assignments for keys, yokes and throttles
- switch panel seems *not* to be included here

C:/Users/Redbird/AppData/Roaming/Lockheed Martin/Prepar3D/SimObjects
- stores accumulated times for each aircraft in state.cfg files

C:/Program Files (x86)/Lockheed Martin/Prepar3D/SimIG.xml
- may have to do with the monitor / view setup

C:/Users/Redbird/My Documents/Prepar3dFiles
- probably stores a temporary flight file (*.FLT) as a result of merging the
*.FLT file on the USB drive (pilot key), the aircraft configuration (*.cfg)
and the *.FLT file under
C:/Redbird/Aircraft

C:/Redbird
- contains general drivers and data

C:/Redbird/RBSim
- contains the main simulation root
- RBSim.exe.Config configures the general simulator components such as
motion platform, directories and switch panel driver
- FSX.cfg configures the general flight simulation items, environment,
controls and components (trusted components)

C:/Redbird/SwitchPanel4
- contains the actively used Redbird switch panel and its configuration
- a test program identifies all events associated with the switch panel
such as KEY_PARKING_BRAKES and KEY_PARKING_BRAKES_OFF

C:/Program Files (x86)/Redbird/Cygnus
- seems to be related to accessing FSX internal variables from external
applications such as the switch panel controller using the FSUIPC library
- according to the manual, Apple devices such as iPhones and iPads can be
connected to the simulator to obtain, for example, position information
(EFB applications)

C:/Redbird/Acrylic
- seems to store aircraft-specific switch panel and control assignments
- there is a library for each aircraft
